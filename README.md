## NOTE: This project is not Affiliated, Associated, Authorized, Endorsed by, or in any way officially connected with Epic Games hence the name of the project

## Second NOTE: This "Project" will only hold work that I have deemed worth writing about. Also I will be taking things out if there is a better version/product

## Third NOTE: **Epic is now taking action against any private server that contains Cosmetics so most Cosmetic Private Servers may not work**

## Yet another NOTE: I will not be posting anything that's been shut down by Magmareef aka *Epic Employee** even if the project still either works or is still being developed for obvious reasons... which of course there arn't any... ðŸ˜³

## Lastly if there is a project on this list that must be taken down Magmareef you have my Discord :/...
This will be a guide on how to set up almost any third party application that deals with Epic Games or Fortnite!
In this Guide you'll find out how to setup 
* Cosmetic Private Servers
* In-Game Private Server *With a Mod*
* Using past replays on old clients (not ready)
* Using a Command Line Version of the Epic Games Launcher called [Legendary](https://github.com/Jawschamp/Unofficial-Epic-Games-products/blob/master/Legendary/README.md) or a Fortnite focused Launcher called EGL3 (**Waiting for release**)
* Tools made by the community for a variety of solutions
