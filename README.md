# Unofficial-Epic-Games-products

# NOTE: This project is not Affiliated, Associated, Authorized, Endorsed by, or in any way officially connected with Epic Games hence the name of the project

# Second Note: This "Project" will only hold work that I have deemed worth writing about. Also I will be taking things out if there is a better version/product

# Third and final Note for now...: **Epic is now taking action against any private server that contain Cosmetics so most Cosmetic Private Server may not work** 
This will be a guide on how to set up almost any third party application that deals with Epic Games or Fortnite!
In this Guide you'll find out how to setup 
* Cosmetic Private Servers
* In-Game Private Server *With a Mod*
* Using past replays on old clients
* Using a Command Line Version of the Epic Games Launcher called [Legendary](https://github.com/Jawschamp/Unofficial-Epic-Games-products/blob/master/Legendary/README.md) or a Fortnite focused Launcher called EGL3 (**Waiting for release**)
