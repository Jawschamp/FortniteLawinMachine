Some people (like myself), may not like the Halloween which is forced on 1.8. I have created a PAK file, which overrides the Halloween lobby with the default lobby.

Download and copy both files to your Fortnite (1.8) Paks directory, enjoy!

NOTE: If for some reason, it doesn't work. Rename both files to pakchunk1-WindowsClient.pak and pakchunk1-WindowsClient.sig, this should fix it if it doesn't work.
